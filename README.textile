h1. rah_minify

p. Rah_minify is a wrapper-plugin for "Textpattern CMS":http://textpattern.com. It minifies specified flat JavaScript and CSS files using "YuiCompressor":https://github.com/yui/yuicompressor/ and "Minify":http://code.google.com/p/minify's CSS Compressor class while the site is in debugging mode. Alternatively it can use "JSMin-php":https://github.com/rgrove/jsmin-php if Java isn't available, and can offer lessphp.

h2. Features

* Minifies specified JavaScript files using YuiCompressor.
* Minifies CSS files using "Minify":http://code.google.com/p/minify package's Minify_CSS_Compressor class.
* If a CSS file ends with .less extension, runs the file with "lessphp":http://leafo.net/lessphp/.

h2. Requirements

* Textpattern
* Java
* PHP5 and access to exec.

h2. Installation

p. The plugin itself doesn't do anything, not without YuiCompressor, and such. Rah_minify basically is just a mere wrapper, a very simple integration that allows YuiCompressor, lessphp and such function with Textpattern.

p. The easiest way to install the plugin is by using "plugin cache directory":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Advanced_Preferences#Plugin_cache_directory_path. If you haven't set it up, you can do it simply by creating a writeable directory, and then setting the path in your site's Preferences.

# Grab a copy of "rah_minify.php":https://github.com/gocom/mck_minify/blob/master/rah_minify.php.
# Copy and save it to your plugin cache directory (named as @rah_minify_v0.1.php@).

p. Now the plugin is would be installed and activated, but as expected it's not doing anything. One thing you would want to do is to grab a copy of:

* Yui Compressor's "yuicompressor.jar":https://github.com/yui/yuicompressor/.
* Minify's "/CSS/Compressor.php":http://code.google.com/p/minify (Minify_CSS_Compressor class).
* JSMin-PHP's "jsmin.php":https://github.com/rgrove/jsmin-php.
* Lessphp's "lessc.inc.php":https://github.com/leafo/lessphp.

p. Download each, place them to your server (e.g. next to your /textpattern directory inside a directory named as minify). After all that byte fetching, that comes time to the configuring. Setting paths; to the required packages and the files that need to be minified. This all would happen from Textpattern's configuration file, @config.php@, located in Textpattern's installation directory.

p. See "config/config.php":https://github.com/gocom/rah_minify/blob/master/config/config.php file for a configuration example. The file is fitted with some comments and instructions. The example config.php file's contents would go to Textpattern installation's config.php file.
